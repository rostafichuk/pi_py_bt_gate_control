# pi_py_bt_gate_control
Raspberry Pi and Python Driveway Gate Control using Bluetooth Proximity for access control.
Note: This is not meant to be secure, it is not, it is meant to be convenient.  Anyone can circumvent any gate security system with a 50 dollar set of lock cutters or even a big rock, no need for bank level security here (these aren't the droids your looking for).

This is written to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W

Instead of using a remote control to operate this gate controller, the Bluetooth Mac of your vehicle or phone can be used to trigger the opening of the gate when in range.

This code is in progress and does not support a strain sensor for safety shutoff yet, only an emergency stop button so far.

Use it at your own risk!
